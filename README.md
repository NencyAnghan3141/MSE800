Assessment 1: Temperature Analysis

I created a NumPy array containing temperature values in Celsius.
Then I performed the following analyses:
Calculated the average temperature.
Identified the highest and lowest temperatures.
Converted all temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Determined which days had temperatures above 20Â°C.
