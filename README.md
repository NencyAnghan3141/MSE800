1: Temperature Analysis

I created a NumPy array containing temperature values in Celsius.
Then I performed the following analyses:
Calculated the average temperature.
Identified the highest and lowest temperatures.
Converted all temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Determined which days had temperatures above 20Â°C.

2: Array Basics

Created an array containing the first 10 positive integers.
Printed the array, and checked its shape and data type.
Multiplied each element in the array by 2 and displayed the updated values.

3: Student Scores

Created a 2D array representing the test scores of 5 students across 3 subjects.
Performed the following calculations:
Computed the average score for each student.
Calculated the average score in each subject.
Identified the student with the highest total score.
Added 5 bonus marks to all students in the third subject.
